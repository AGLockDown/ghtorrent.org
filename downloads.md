### What am I downloading?

* The MySQL dump is a full, up to date database dump. You can safely use it for querying the latest available data.
* The MongoDB dumps are provided mostly for reference and backup purposes, as they may contain duplicates. The reasons for this are the following:
  * When refreshing project data, old records are deleted and new are added. This cannot be reflected in the dumps (it is not practical to regenerate all dumps every time).
  * The dumps have already been restored once, hence the dump dates do not
represent the actual data generation dates.

For those reasons, we recommend using the MongoDB data through our [query
service](http://ghtorrent.org/raw.html). 

### MySQL database dumps 

You can also [query MySQL](/dblite). It is always loaded with the latest
dump.
